# GitSome
First time I looked…
…your blob objects got me hooked.

You got me feeling the urge…
…to do an evil branch merge.

We could even do true core GIT. 
It´s not that strange, is it?

You see…

…I want to put my dirty dangling object inside…
…merge my master to your pack… 
…pack my objects into your working tree… 

…go plumbing inside your bare repository.

My pickaxe is ready to push, pull…  
…even go octopus in full.

And commit isn´t necessary if you give me HEAD…
…just grant access – I’ll rebase your porcelain instead.
